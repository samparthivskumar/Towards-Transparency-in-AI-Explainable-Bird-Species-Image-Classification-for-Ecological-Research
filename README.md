Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an evolving field focused on making AI models more interpretable and transparent. This is particularly significant in domains like agriculture, healthcare, and environmental science, where the outcomes of AI-driven decisions can directly impact critical aspects like safety, ethics, and human well-being. By providing insight into how complex models, especially deep neural networks, arrive at their predictions, XAI fosters a deeper level of trust between users and AI systems.

In the context of image classification, XAI tools offer intuitive visualizations that highlight the regions or features of an image that the model considers important when making predictions. For example, in the task of recognizing bird species, explainable models can identify and emphasize specific visual characteristics, such as the bird’s plumage or beak shape, demonstrating that the model's decisions are grounded in relevant and logical features rather than noise or irrelevant data.

When evaluating different models, it's not sufficient to rely on accuracy metrics alone. While accuracy provides a measure of how often a model makes correct predictions, XAI visualizations give us critical insight into why a model makes those predictions. Understanding this reasoning process is key to ensuring that models align with human expectations and focus on meaningful features. Models that consistently focus on relevant features are more dependable, reducing the likelihood of errors or biases in critical applications.

However, qualitative analysis of XAI visualizations, which typically involves subjective human interpretation of visual outputs (such as saliency maps), can be inconsistent and difficult to scale. A quantitative approach to analyzing these visualizations provides an objective and scalable framework for evaluating models. By automating the assessment process, large datasets and complex models can be systematically examined, enabling a more thorough and unbiased evaluation.

In our study, we propose a novel, fully quantitative methodology to evaluate XAI models. Our approach involves three key steps:

Assessing Model Accuracy – Measuring the traditional accuracy of the model to establish its prediction performance.
Feature Relevance Evaluation – Determining whether the model correctly identifies the most relevant features influencing its predictions.
Overall Evaluation – Combining accuracy and feature relevance findings to assess the model's ability to produce reliable and interpretable explanations.
By adopting this quantitative approach, we are able to provide a clearer, more systematic evaluation of XAI visualizations, which improves the trustworthiness and transparency of AI models. This method supports the development of AI systems that are not only high-performing but also interpretable and aligned with human reasoning—an essential factor for their successful deployment in real-world applications.
