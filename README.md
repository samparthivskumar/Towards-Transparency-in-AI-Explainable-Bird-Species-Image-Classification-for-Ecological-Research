**Description**

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an evolving field focused on making AI models more interpretable and transparent. This is particularly significant in domains like agriculture, healthcare, and environmental science, where the outcomes of AI-driven decisions can directly impact critical aspects like safety, ethics, and human well-being. By providing insight into how complex models, especially deep neural networks, arrive at their predictions, XAI fosters a deeper level of trust between users and AI systems.

In the context of image classification, XAI tools offer intuitive visualizations that highlight the regions or features of an image that the model considers important when making predictions. For example, in the task of recognizing bird species, explainable models can identify and emphasize specific visual characteristics, such as the bird’s plumage or beak shape, demonstrating that the model's decisions are grounded in relevant and logical features rather than noise or irrelevant data.

When evaluating different models, it is not sufficient to rely on accuracy metrics alone. While accuracy provides a measure of how often a model makes correct predictions, XAI visualizations give us critical insight into why a model makes those predictions. Understanding this reasoning process is key to ensuring that models align with human expectations and focus on meaningful features. Models that consistently focus on relevant features are more dependable, reducing the likelihood of errors or biases in critical applications.

However, qualitative analysis of XAI visualizations, which typically involves subjective human interpretation of visual outputs can be inconsistent and difficult to scale. A quantitative approach to analyzing these visualizations provides an objective and scalable framework for evaluating models. By automating the assessment process, large datasets and complex models can be systematically examined, enabling a more thorough and unbiased evaluation.

Our study introduces a quantitative approach to evaluating XAI models. This involves a three-step process: first, measuring the accuracy of each pretrained model to establish its prediction performance; second, assessing feature relevance using LIME to determine whether the model correctly identifies the key features influencing its decisions; and finally, using IoU scores to compare the LIME-generated explanations with the ground-truth regions of interest. By combining these findings—accuracy, LIME-based feature relevance, and IoU scores—we comprehensively evaluate the model’s overall performance and explanation quality. This methodology ensures that the models are both high-performing and transparent, essential for trust and successful deployment in real-world ecological applications.
